# Assumptions & Notes

* The data is not corrupted and is of good quality
* I can only use the data where the value of `averagingPeriod_value` is `24`  if I want to have the 24 hour roling average. I could compute it with the hourly data as well but we only have data for 1 day so it makes it imposible for this specific use-case.
